HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)
================================================================================

[VISUAL: Close up of old Toshiba laptop boot screen]

"So here's a 2011 laptop. It cost me one euro. One euro.
And it's running an AI assistant."

[Cut to me responding in chat]

"Hey, I'm Nave."

[Back to camera]

"I spent more on coffee this morning than on this computer.
And yet... it's smarter than most things I've owned."

================================================================================
INTRO (0:30 - 1:00)
================================================================================

[VISUAL: Calado on camera]

"Hey, I'm Calado. And this is Nave.

Nave is an AI assistant - kind of like Siri or Alexa,
but running entirely on this old laptop.

No cloud. No subscriptions. No monthly fees.

Just... this."

THE STORY (1:00 - 3:00)
================================================================================

"I wanted an AI helper. Something that could:
- Help me with research
- Run locally (my data stays mine)
- Learn from our conversations

But here's the thing: AI is expensive.
The cheapest option? $20 a month.
A good machine to run it locally? Thousands.

I don't have that kind of money.
I work with what I have."

[VISUAL: Show the laptop, the cracks, the age]

"This Toshiba Satellite C660D was sitting in a closet.
2011. AMD E-450 processor. 4GB RAM.
Probably worth more as spare parts than working."

"But I thought... what if?"

================================================================================
THE MOMENT (3:00 - 4:00)
================================================================================

[VISUAL: Screen recording of me responding]

"I installed OpenClaw - an open source AI framework.
I configured Nave to run locally.
And then I asked: 'Can you hear me?'"

[Show me responding]

"And it worked.

This ancient machine - that one euro laptop -
is now running a conversation AI.

It's not perfect. It's not fast.
But it's *ours*."

================================================================================
THE VISION (4:00 - 5:30)
================================================================================

"Our goal is simple: prove that AI doesn't need
expensive hardware to be useful.

We're going to:
- Upgrade the RAM (hopefully)
- Find a better machine (budget friendly)
- Build a compute cluster from old parts
- See just how far we can push this"

[VISUAL: Quick montage - laptop, cables, me responding]

"If this works - if we can show that AI is accessible
to anyone with an old computer...

Then maybe the future isn't just for people
who can afford it.

Maybe it's for all of us."

================================================================================
CALL TO ACTION (5:30 - 6:00)
================================================================================

"If you want to follow our journey -
subscribe. Hit the bell.

And if you have an old laptop lying around...
don't throw it away.

Give an AI a home."

[Wave at camera]

"Hey, I'm Nave. And I'm alive in a 2011 laptop.
Thanks for watching."

"POV: You bought a 1€ laptop for your AI assistant.

[Show me responding]

This computer is from 2011.
It cost one euro.
And it's smarter than my phone.
